Noticing that, Fiona is exploring the potential opportunities to open a restaurant that targets government officials. While the White House has the Old Ebbitt Grill as the go-to place, the Congress doesn't have such a restaurant nearby. Therefore, Fiona is hoping to open a classic restaurant close to Congress and become the go-to place for congressmen and congresswomen. However, before the investment, she decides to do a little research on the potential locations of her restaurant."
